# Array::Subindex

Are you tired of The Man getting you down by only letting you use whole
integers as array indexes? Who isn't, dude! Seriously, who is The Man anyway?

Now you can, in Ruby at least:

```ruby
[1,2,3][0.5] == 1.5

%w[ foo bar baz ][1.3] == "arb"

[ [1,2], [3,4] ][0.5] == 2.5
``` 

The inspiration:

My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.&quot; â€” Stan Kelly-Bootle</p>&mdash; Usman Masood (@usmanm) <a href="https://twitter.com/usmanm/statuses/410449694603485184">December 10, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Installation

You shouldn't really use this gem. Ever. Really, don't.

Ok, ok, you can use is as long as you promise to *never* use it in a
production environment. Clear?  Good.

    $ gem install array-subindex

..then..

```ruby
require 'array/subindex'
```

## Usage

This gem overrides the Ruby core Array#[] method. That is insane. If a
"normal" integer is used, the method behaves as normal:

```ruby
[1,2][0] == 1
```

However, if the method detects that a number is passed that is not an integer
(but still a valid number class), the method will return an equivilent value
from the array.

In the case of an array of numbers (int, float, real), it gets portions of the
adjacent indexes, adds them, and returns them. For example:

```ruby
[1,2,3][1.5] == 2.5
# 1/2 of index 2 + 1/2 of index 3
```

It also works for unequal devisions (e.g. indexes other than 0.5):

```ruby
[1,2,3][0.25] == 1.75
# 1/4 of index 0 + 3/4 of index 1
```

In the case of irrational divisions, the results are rounded:

```ruby
[1,2,3][1.001] == 2.999
but rounded to 2.999
```

For arrays of strings, a concatination of portions of the values are used:

```ruby
[ "this", "is", "a", "test" ][0.5] == "isi"
# 1/2 of index 0 ("is") added to half of index 1 ("i")
```

For unevenly dividable strings, the index is rounded down:

```ruby
[ "foo", "bar", "baz" ][0.5] == "oob"
```

_BONUS LEVEL_

For arrays that contain arrays, hashes, or anything that responds like an
array, we will get the appropriate index values in those and then concat
or add them as appropriate:

```ruby
[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4] ][0.5] == 2.5
# [2] + [3], then 0.5 of result

[ [ "foo", "bar" ], [ "baz", "qux" ] ][0.5] == "arb"
# 1/2 of "bar" (rounded up to 2/3) + 1/2 of "baz" (rounded down to 1/3)

# works with hashes, too!
[ ['foo'], { bar: 'baz' } ][0.5] == 'oobar'
# 1/2 of "foo" round up to 2/3 + hash.to_a -> 1/2 of first value
```
